# Chrono-Lane
This program was developed to help swim coaches manage the lap times of multple swimmers across multiple lanes.  The user is given the option to enter the amount of lanes they want to manage (1 to 8).  The user is then presented with a series of timers, one for each lane, which they can start and stop independently of one another using threads.
